        <h1>Kai Goodall</h1>
        <p>
            I’m currently building liquid bipropellant rockets at 
            <a href="https://www.waterloorocketry.com/" target="_blank">Waterloo Rocketry</a> 
            and giving out microgrants to capital-constrained builders at 
            <a href="https://merge.club/" target="_blank">Merge Club</a>
            .
        </p>
        <p>I turned down a $500 000 total compensation job in Silicon Valley to study Physics and Astronomy at the University of Waterloo.</p>
        
        <p>In my free time, I shoot photos on film, go whitewater kayaking, downhill ski, and visit new coffee shops. My best time is spent working on a project I’m passionate about or trying something new with friends.</p>
